# Handwritten-digit-recognition-practice

This repository is a practice project of handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset and convolutional neural network. 

The [digits](https://github.com/NiladriMallik/Handwritten-digit-recognition-practice/tree/main/digits) folder contains the images of the digits to make the predictions on. Each image is a 28 x 28 pixel image. To add new images for predictions, we just have to create a new 28 x 28 image containing a digit and place it in the folder. Then run the notebook again to append the image to the lists of the images and the filenames. I have used an MLPClassifier to make the predictions.

The final predictions are not accurate. Only 4 out of 10 digits were predicted correctly.
